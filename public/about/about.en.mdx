## Yoonsu Lee

I aim to be an AI-friendly frontend developer.  
I enjoy quickly experimenting with ideas and turning them into services, and I strive to create services that are **more fun and more convenient**.
Recently, I've been actively adopting various AI tools and agent-based development workflows to optimize the planning–development–testing process.

### About

- When I get an **idea**, I build and experiment with toy projects using TypeScript-based React, Next.js, and NestJS.
- **Image optimization** (WebP conversion, CDN, pre-injected metadata) to improve web performance (LCP/CLS), and actively using TanStack Query caching strategies.
- For **AI agent**-based development, I built and published a CLI tool (lee-spec-kit) on npm to standardize document structure and workflows, applying Spec-driven development to my projects.
- I'm also interested in **infrastructure**; I've operated Oracle Cloud servers for two years and use the open-source PaaS platform Coolify to deploy and manage toy projects in container environments.
