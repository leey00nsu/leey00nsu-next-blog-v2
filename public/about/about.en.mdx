# Yoonsu Lee

I enjoy quickly experimenting with ideas and turning them into product-shaped implementations, and I aim to build services that run reliably in production environments.  
Recently, I have been improving workflows that use AI tools and agents to shorten the planning-development-testing loop and automate repetitive tasks.

### About

- I quickly validate and implement features from **ideas** through side projects focused on React and Next.js.
- To improve **UI/UX**, I measure with Lighthouse, analyze root causes, and iterate on improvements.
- I actively use **AI** in development. I mainly use Codex and use Claude when needed.
- For **AI agent** based development, I built and published a [CLI for document structure and workflow standardization](https://github.com/leey00nsu/lee-spec-kit), and apply Spec-driven development in projects.
- I have been operating **Oracle Cloud servers for two years**, and deploy/manage side projects in container environments using the open-source PaaS platform Coolify.
