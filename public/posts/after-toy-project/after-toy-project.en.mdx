## Conducting a Small-Scale Project

During my undergraduate studies, I have had the opportunity to experience various projects.

From my first project, where I knew nothing, to now, after a year of collaboration, I would like to share what I have learned and felt.

### The Importance of Planning

To create a good service, good planning is essential.

A project that starts from a simple idea can become a great project when **the stories of many people are added.**

At the undergraduate level, this process is mostly limited to team projects or club activities, so to gain diverse experiences, it seems beneficial to **participate in external competitions or events.**

### How to Design a Project

In the `Capstone Design` course, I had the opportunity to learn in detail about `flowcharts` and `wireframes` from my mentor.

First, I create a `flowchart`, and based on that flowchart, I develop a `wireframe`.

At this point, **the most important thing is that all team members must share the same understanding.**

One of the challenges I faced during projects was that many meetings were conducted verbally, and without documenting them, we often repeated discussions and **asked the same questions repeatedly.**

To prevent this, it is essential to create accurate `documentation` that can serve as a base for development.

I also learned about the `Agile process`.

### How Should Meetings Be Conducted?

To move away from the **haphazard meetings**, I started looking into other projects.

Among them, I found the retrospective of [Teo's Sprint](https://velog.io/@teo/google-sprint-1), which was conducted based on Google Sprint, particularly interesting, and I applied it to our work.

Although there are originally more steps, I condensed the process into three stages: `Canvas` → `Idea Sketch` → `Implementation`.

In the `Team Canvas`, we conduct light ice-breaking by allowing team members to freely jot down their thoughts.

In the `Idea Sketch`, we write down ideas and select the final idea through presentations and voting.

During `Implementation`, we discussed how to visualize each feature based on the ideas to finalize the implementation.

Following this process naturally led us to `one result`.

Regardless of the final implementation, I observed that all team members were satisfied with the **outcome of introducing this process.**

### How Should Collaboration Be Done?

I understand that in the industry, various collaboration tools such as `GitHub`, `Slack`, and `Jira` are used.

Since I thought that learning Jira would present a learning curve for other team members, we communicated using Slack.

On GitHub, we created a team organization to separate the frontend and backend repositories, and used projects to **track issues by sprint for each repository.**

In our projects, we used `React`, and after much consideration to implement a **better architectural structure**, I found a [great article](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react) that served as a valuable reference.

Additionally, based on the `Airbnb` JavaScript style guide, we applied `eslint` and `prettier` rules to ensure **consistent code syntax among team members.**

### Conclusion

I always feel that while conducting projects, there are moments when I think, **I should have done this differently, or it would have been better to proceed in another way.**

However, I also feel that as I progress through projects, I can approach the next one in a better way, and I am growing as a developer who wants to continue finding better methods.
