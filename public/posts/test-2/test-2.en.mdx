On September 15 (KST), Manchester City decisively defeated Manchester United 3-0 in the 4th round of the 2025-26 English Premier League (EPL) held at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.

Having escaped a two-game losing streak, Manchester City improved to 2 wins and 2 losses (6 points), rising to 8th place. Manchester United remained in 14th place with 1 win, 1 draw, and 2 losses (4 points).

Manchester City took the lead in the 18th minute of the first half with a header goal from Phil Foden. Foden leaped to attempt a header from a cross delivered by Jeremy Doku from the right flank, scoring the opening goal.

In the 53rd minute, Erling Haaland, assisted by Doku, added another goal, extending the lead to two goals. Haaland received a forward pass from Doku and shook the Manchester United net with a powerful left-footed shot.

Despite being two goals down, Manchester United pushed their lines forward to mount a counterattack, but instead exposed weaknesses in their defense. Haaland seized the opportunity and scored another goal in the 68th minute during a counterattack, sealing the victory.

Goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, who joined Manchester City from Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) at the end of the transfer window, made his starting debut and contributed to the victory by saving both of Manchester United's shots on target.

Defending champions Liverpool traveled to Burnley and secured a hard-fought 1-0 victory, marking their fourth consecutive win to start the season.

Liverpool dominated the match with 80% possession and attempted 27 shots. However, they struggled to find the net, failing to score a single goal during regular time.

In a match where they dominated throughout, Liverpool narrowly avoided a draw when Mohamed Salah successfully converted a penalty kick awarded for a handball in stoppage time, securing a 1-0 victory.
