Gerrard participated as a member of FC Sphere (the attacking team) in the '2025 Icon Match: The Return of Creativity, The Beginning of the Counterattack' hosted by Nexon at the Seoul World Cup Stadium on the 14th. Although the team lost 1-2 to Shield United (the defensive team), Gerrard's presence shone brightly.

Expectations for Gerrard, who set foot on Korean soil for the first time through this Icon Match, were evident even before the game. As soon as news of Gerrard's participation broke, fans responded enthusiastically, and it was easy to spot fans wearing his Liverpool jerseys in the stadium.

The same excitement was palpable when the players from both teams were introduced before the match. Despite the presence of many star players, the cheers grew louder when Gerrard's name was called. The day before, during the event match Power Door, Gerrard showcased his unchanged kicking power by breaking 14 out of 15 styrofoam walls.
