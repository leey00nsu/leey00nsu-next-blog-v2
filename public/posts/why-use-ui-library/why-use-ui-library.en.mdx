## Reasons to Use a Frontend UI Library

![mantine](/public/posts/why-use-ui-library/mantine.webp)

In the recent [noveloper](https://github.com/leey00nsu/noveloper) project, I used the UI library Mantine.

Additionally, I have used various frontend UI libraries such as `bootstrap`, `shadcn`, `daisyUI`, and `NextUI` in most of the projects I have worked on.

So, why did I use these **libraries**?

### There's No Need to Reinvent the Wheel

**Building all components from scratch and styling them from the ground up is not an easy task.**

Even if you create visually appealing components using `CSS`, you still need to consider aspects such as `browser compatibility`, `accessibility`, `responsive design`, and `performance`.

UI libraries take these factors into account, **testing and developing components, and maintaining them through the community, which allows for a more efficient solution than handling everything alone.**

(With 24.7k stars, Mantine has only 24 issues, indicating how well it is maintained.)

Moreover, using pre-built components allows for rapid prototyping of projects.

### Frontend Developers and Designers

**I am not good at design.**

However, as a frontend developer, providing users with a **clean UI** has always been a concern for me.

Ensuring that different UI components maintain consistency is not an easy task.

UI libraries generally have a consistent design and present a clean and organized appearance, making them excellent as a **base design**.

### Design Systems and Customization

That said, not all projects using a UI library will have the same design.

Most libraries offer **customization options for individual components, as well as the ability to modify themes for overall project customization, allowing you to build a `design system` tailored to each project.**

For example, you can find out why Inflab developed its design system based on the open-source Mantine in their article on [building a design system](https://tech.inflab.com/20240224-design-system/).

### Drawbacks

So, is using a UI library **always the right choice?**

It's important to consider the following drawbacks as well:

- `Open Source`: Open-source projects always carry the risk of maintenance being halted. Additionally, the development direction of the open-source library may differ from what the project desires.
- `Bundle Size`: Including all components of the library in the code can lead to performance issues.
- `Dependencies`: If the UI library depends on other libraries, issues may arise during version updates.
- `Learning Curve`: The team will need time to learn the library.

Therefore, it seems wise to choose a UI library based on project requirements through discussions among team members.

### Conclusion

While I have used various UI libraries throughout my projects, I initially thought of it simply as a matter of convenience.

By posting this article, I feel that I can clearly articulate the reasons I had in mind while also exploring the thoughts of other developers regarding the use of UI libraries.
