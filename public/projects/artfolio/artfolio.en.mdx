## Project Overview

GitHub : [https://github.com/leey00nsu/ArtFolio-FE](https://github.com/leey00nsu/ArtFolio-FE)

This is an AI-powered art auction service. When a user uploads a painting, the AI analyzes it and automatically generates descriptions and audio, and items can be traded through a real-time auction system.  
The project won the Encouragement Award at the Sahmyook University SW Project Competition, and I served as the team lead and was responsible for **frontend development and team leadership**.

## Key Features

- Real-time art auctions and bidding using WebSockets (Stomp.js)

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, Nivo, Stomp.js
