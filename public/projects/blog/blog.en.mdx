## Project Overview

GitHub : [https://github.com/leey00nsu/leey00nsu-next-blog-v2](https://github.com/leey00nsu/leey00nsu-next-blog-v2)
Demo : [https://blog2.leey00nsu.com](https://blog2.leey00nsu.com)

This is a technology blog built with Next.js. Articles written in the built-in web editor are automatically translated between Korean and English by AI, and are committed directly to a branch via the GitHub API to automate deployment.
**A fully automated blog pipeline from writing to deployment** is a key feature.

## Key Features

- MDX-based blog (syntax highlighting, image metadata, etc.)
- Studio editor (Tiptap) for authoring frontmatter/body and uploading images
- GitHub API (Octokit) auto-commit for MDX/images
- i18n: `next-intl` + OpenAI-powered translation
- AI image generation from selected text (requires `LEESFIELD_API_KEY`)
- Playwright-based portfolio PDF generation

## Problem

- **Overhead of multilingual content**: Manually maintaining Korean and English versions leads to drift and omissions
- **Friction to deployment**: A manual write → translate → commit → deploy loop is repetitive and error-prone
- **Image performance issues**: Missing sizing/placeholder metadata can easily degrade LCP/CLS
- **Access control**: Editing capabilities need protection to prevent abuse

## Solution

- Standardize the authoring flow with a web-based MDX editor
- Synchronize Korean/English content with OpenAI-powered translation
- Automate commits to a branch via GitHub API (Octokit) to streamline deployment
- Pre-generate image metadata (width/height/LQIP) to stabilize rendering and improve performance
- Restrict Studio access via GitHub OAuth (NextAuth) with an allowlist approach
- Automate portfolio PDF output with a Playwright-based pipeline
- Improve maintainability by structuring the codebase with Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)

## Impact

- **Lower ops cost**: Less repetitive work thanks to automated translation and deployment
- **Better consistency**: Tighter coupling between docs, code, and deployment reduces missed updates
- **Improved web performance**: More stable image rendering contributes to better LCP/CLS
- **Automated deliverables**: Portfolio PDFs are generated automatically for easy sharing
