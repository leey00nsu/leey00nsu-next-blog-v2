## Project Overview

GitHub : [https://github.com/leey00nsu/lee-spec-kit](https://github.com/leey00nsu/lee-spec-kit)  
npm : [https://www.npmjs.com/package/lee-spec-kit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lee-spec-kit)

When working with AI coding assistants, the biggest bottleneck often becomes **inconsistent documentation structure and missing context** across projects.  
`lee-spec-kit` is a CLI that helps you **bootstrap a predictable docs structure** and keep a consistent feature workflow (`spec → plan → tasks → decisions`) so both humans and agents can collaborate with less friction.
Based on spec-kit’s docs structure and workflow, it was designed to make Spec-driven development (SDD) easy to adopt in real projects.

## Key Features

- Enforces Spec-driven development workflow: standardizes the “spec → plan → tasks → decisions” flow per feature so intent, design, execution, and decisions stay traceable.
- Standardized docs structure: provides a consistent docs skeleton (agents/prd/features, shared templates) to keep documentation shape and quality predictable.
- Feature-centric doc management: organizes artifacts in per-feature folders so progress is visible at a glance and review, prioritization, and history tracking are straightforward.
- Agent-friendly context: outputs the current feature’s key context and next actions so humans and agents follow the same process.
- Template updates: provides a maintenance path to keep templates and guides (agents, skills, etc.) up to date.

## Problem

- **Context overhead for agents**: documentation structure and conventions vary across projects
- **Fragmented workflow**: spec/plan/tasks/decisions are scattered, making reviews and progress tracking harder
- **Doc quality drift**: missing files/status, duplicate IDs, and leftover placeholders accumulate over time

## Solution

- Provide a standardized docs skeleton and shared templates to keep documentation structure consistent
- Automatically scaffold feature artifacts (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, `decisions.md`) to preserve the SDD flow
- Summarize current state/next actions and integrate with automation via JSON output
- Validate structure/metadata and keep templates up to date to prevent documentation drift

## Impact

- **Lower onboarding/communication cost**: standardized docs make context sharing simpler
- **Better feature visibility**: templated workflow keeps progress consistent and reviewable
- **Sustained doc quality**: automated validation catches structural/metadata issues early

## Tech Stack

- Runtime: Node.js
- Language/Build: TypeScript, tsup
- CLI: Commander.js, prompts, chalk
