## Project Overview

GitHub : [https://github.com/leey00nsu/leesfield](https://github.com/leey00nsu/leesfield)
Demo : [https://leesfield.leey00nsu.com/](https://leesfield.leey00nsu.com/)

When adding AI image/video generation to side projects, I wanted to build my **own pipeline**.
Most image/video generation APIs are paid, but **Hugging Face Zero GPU** offers limited free usage, allowing me to start without cost concerns.

Currently only the Hugging Face adapter is implemented, but the **adapter pattern design** allows easy integration with other AI APIs (OpenAI, Replicate, etc.) in the future.
It provides various AI models (FLUX, etc.) through a unified UI/API and automatically saves generated results to storage via Leemage integration.

## Key Features

- AI image/video generation: Adapter-based extensible architecture (currently provides free Hugging Face Space adapter)
- Model catalog management: DB-based model registration/editing, dynamic UI rendering
- Monitoring dashboard: Generation request status and monitoring
- Generation history management: All generation requests saved to DB
- External API: OpenAPI auto-generation based on Zod schemas
- Leemage integration: Automatic upload of generated results
- i18n support: Korean/English

## Problem

- **AI model diversity**: Different API interfaces, parameters, and timeouts for each model
- **Storage integration**: External storage integration needed for permanent result storage
- **Model configuration management**: Need to manage model-specific parameters, UI types, and defaults without code modification
- **API documentation mismatch**: When managing API docs separately, inconsistencies between code and documentation can occur
- **Difficulty tracking generation requests**: Hard to monitor success/failure rates and processing delays in real-time

## Solution

- **API call adapter pattern**: Separate adapters per model provider (hf_space, etc.), implement only adapters for new providers
- **Storage adapter pattern**: Separate external storage integration (Leemage, etc.) into adapters
- **DB-based model catalog**: Register model settings/parameters via admin UI, add new models without code changes
- **OpenAPI auto-generation**: Auto-generate OpenAPI spec from Zod schemas for API documentation and type synchronization
- **Integrated monitoring dashboard**: Real-time view of request status (active/pending/processing), error rates, and avg/P95 latency. Model/API key statistics and daily trend charts

## Impact

- **Cost savings**: Utilizing Hugging Face Space free GPU
- **Model scalability**: Add new models without code modification via DB model catalog
- **Storage integration**: Permanent generation history preservation via Leemage integration
- **Operational visibility**: Real-time monitoring for immediate request status and error rate tracking
- **Multilingual support**: Korean/English i18n

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- Data/Validation: TanStack Query, Zod
- Backend/DB: Next.js API Routes, Prisma, PostgreSQL, iron-session
- AI: Hugging Face Space, Gradio Client
